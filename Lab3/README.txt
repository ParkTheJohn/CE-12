LAB 3: Looping in MIPS

------------------------- 
 
The text of your prompt (“Please input a positive integer: ”) and output strings (“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the processor’s memory. 
After assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored? 
The range of addresses that store the strings are 0x1001000 to 0x10010038.

What were the learning objectives of this lab? 
The learning objectives of this lab was to learn how to use MIPS programming language
in MARS IDE. Another objective of this lab was implementing a logic structure for Flux and Bunny
using branches in MIPS, instead of the common if-statements.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? 
I did not encounter any critical issues throughout this lab. Though I had to debug why the division was not 
working properly for a bit, it did not take too long to fix. Figuring out how to implement branches as if-statements 
was very enjoyable. This lab was a lot more enjoyable than working with MML, partly because it was more related to "coding"
than logic circuits. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better? 
I would probably not redesign the lab because I feel that it was very good amount of work and a great way to learn MIPS and MARS.
If I had to redesign, I would add another step to it, maybe include negative numbers as well.
