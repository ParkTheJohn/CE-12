What did you learn in this lab?
Through this lab, I learned how to use Multimedia Logic. I also learned how to
implement logic for truth tables using OR, AND, NOR, and NAND gates.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
The implementation part of the lab worked very well for me. Because I took
CE 16 last year, implementing logic from the truth tables to circuits made 
a lot of sense to me. The issue I encountered was browsing through Multimedia Logic.
I had to ask during the lab section to understand how to properly use MML because
the tutorial function in MML did not work for me.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would redesign this lab in a way that utilizes more on logic thinking, such as
part C. Part A and part B did not take very long, but Part C was definitely time consuming
and helped me learn.
